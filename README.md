# Adaptive Noise Cancellation using LMS Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project implements an adaptive noise cancellation system using the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm. The system effectively filters out additive noise from audio signals, resulting in cleaner, more intelligible speech output.

## Background
Noise cancellation is a critical technology in modern audio processing systems, from headphones to telecommunications. Adaptive filtering techniques like LMS are particularly powerful because they can adjust to changing noise conditions in real-time, making them ideal for dynamic environments.

## Technical Approach

### LMS Algorithm
The Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is an adaptive filter that:
- Minimizes the mean square error between a desired signal and the filter output
- Continuously updates filter coefficients based on the error signal
- Adapts to changing noise characteristics over time

### Implementation Process
1. **Signal Generation**: Combined clean speech audio with real noise samples at controlled signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)
2. **Filter Design**: Implemented an adaptive filter using the LMS algorithm
3. **Parameter Optimization**: Tuned step size and filter order for optimal performance
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Measured noise reduction and speech quality metrics

## Key Features
- **Real-time Processing**: The algorithm can process audio streams in real-time
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Automatically adjusts to different noise environments
- **Minimal Distortion**: Preserves speech quality while reducing noise
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable step size and filter order for different scenarios

## Results
The implementation successfully:
- Reduced noise levels by up to 15-20 dB in various test scenarios
- Maintained speech intelligibility and quality
- Demonstrated robustness against different noise types (white noise, ambient noise, etc.)
- Showed fast convergence to optimal filter coefficients
